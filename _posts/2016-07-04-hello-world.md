That's how we developers start something new.

I'm starting this blog with the idea that I can give something back
to the community. I've learned a lot while developing at the young start-up
**[xamoom](https://www.xamoom.com)** and I wont stop learning new stuff.

Follow me on this blog and learn some new things and also help me to get better
in what I do.

I will blog about Android & iOS development, simple design
related topics and everything that can help you!
